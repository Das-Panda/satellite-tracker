# Satellite Tracker

A Python-based satellite tracker and contact logger for HAM radio operators. Supports real-time tracking, ISS pass prediction, hardware aiming via Raspberry Pi and servo motors, and contact logging.

## Goals
- Track ISS and amateur radio satellites using live TLE data
- Control a directional antenna via servos
- Use GPS input for automatic ground station location
- Log confirmed contacts and track satellite QSO history

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- GPS Dongle (e.g., VK-162)
- 2x Servo Motors (azimuth/elevation)
- Directional Antenna (Yagi)
